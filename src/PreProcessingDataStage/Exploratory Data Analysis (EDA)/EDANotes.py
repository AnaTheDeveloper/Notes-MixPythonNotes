# The term Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short) refers to the process of discovering patterns and relationships
# within a dataset. EDA is about making sense of the data at hand and getting to know it, often before modeling or
# analysis. EDA is an important step prior to model building and can help you formulate further questions and areas
# for investigation.

# the main goals of EDA are generally:
# Uncover the data structure and determine how it is coded.
# Inspect and “get to know” the data by summarizing and visualizing it.
# Detect outliers, missing data, and other anomalies and decide how/whether to address these issues.
# Find new avenues for analysis and further research.
# Prepare for model building or analysis, including the following:
    # Check assumptions
    # Select features
    # Choose an appropriate method

# EDA techniques:
    # Data inspection
    # Numerical summarization
    # Data visualization

# Inspect, Clean, and Validate a Dataset

# Initial Data Inspection

# Before analysis or cleaning, it is useful to print a few rows of data. This helps ensure that the data is properly
# loaded. It also allows us to compare the observed data to the data dictionary and determine whether the
# coding appears to match our expectations.

# Data Information

# Once we’ve taken a first look at some data, a common next step is to address questions such as:
# How many (non-null) observations do we have?
# How many unique columns/features do we have?
# Which columns (if any) contain missing data?
# What is the data type of each column?

# Inspecting Missing Data

# Find out WHY the data is missing, which can help us make decisions about whether to get rid of the
# rows altogether or impute the missing values somehow.
